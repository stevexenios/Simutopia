Motherhood state:
	- Allow the use of randomized gene.value;
	-random: boolean [radio]
		- maxBonusForGene
	-Costlier learning Bonus
		- 
	-Cycles of 10000, 
		-individualStart
		-socialStart
		
	-Difficulty for different cells..

	-Bug on reproduction not working

Working on:
1. Experiment Manager
2. Learning Bonus Histograms
3. Social Learning Optimum, pick the agent with the highest value in the learning bonus array
4. Mean on histogram

Experiment Manager: 01/30/2020 - Present
1. Updated so that UI can change env. bonus pattern
2. Updated So that UI can change social learning scope and agents selection
3. Updated so that they can be changed on UI: World Difficulty, Reproduction cost, and Repro Base Factor 
4. Learnign Rates Updated

Incomplete: 01/04/2020 - 01/10/2020
- Divide the Layouts into 3 seperate ones:
	- Buttons
	- Checkboxes
	- Input
- Enable functionality of all the above

Completed: 01/03/2020
-Combine the 3 files for Genomes into one. 
-Increase number of parameters during genome construction. 
-Add labels of the genome for the 3 genome types.

Ouroboros programs
-The quine concept can be extended to multiple levels of recursion, originating "ouroboros programs", or quine-relays. This should not be confused with Multiquines.
- Conway's Game of Life showed examples of how emergence and self-organization can emerge without objective direction.


- The Garden of Eden pattern
- Von_Neumann Universal Constructor

Based on the Game of Life:
1.There should be no explosive growth.
2.There should exist small initial patterns with chaotic, unpredictable outcomes.
3.There should be potential for von Neumann universal constructors.
4.The rules should be as simple as possible, whilst adhering to the above constraints.

Universal Concepts
-In Evolutionary Systems mutation increases diversity in the population and selection acts as a force increasing quality.
-Many Aspects of Evolution are Stochastic, random. 
-On the other hand, selection operators can be either deterministic, or stochastic. 
-In the latter case, individuals with a higher fitness have a higher chance to be selected than individuals with a lower fitness, 
 but typically even the weak individuals have a chance to become a parent or to survive.


Termination conditions:
- Fixed Number of Generations
- Average Web Browser time to Compute and diplay the simulation is exceeded by a certain factor
- Manual Inspection

Motility and Motion
- Taxis is the movement of an organism in response to a stimulus such as light or the presence of food. Taxes are innate behavioural responses. A taxis differs from a 
- Tropism which is a turning response, often growth towards or away from a stimulus

In the case of taxis, the organism has motility and demonstrates guided movement towards or away from the stimulus source.

 Kinesis, a non-directional change in activity in response to a stimulus.
 
 Mnemotaxis is the use of memory to follow trails that organisms have left when travelling to or from their home.

 The dimensions of the world grid is any finite number of dimensions.

 - Genetic Algorithms are used to generate high quality solutions ot optimization and earch problems relying on bio-inspired operators such as mutation and selction.

 - The Price equation shows that a change in the average amount of a trait in a population
from one generation to the next is determined by the covariance between the amounts of the
trait for subpopulations, together with the expected change in the amount of the trait value
due to fitness.
